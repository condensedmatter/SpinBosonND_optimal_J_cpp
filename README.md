## the goal of this repo is to find optimal jumping step during Monte Carlo, also estimate the error CPU time relation

main_proj_1.cpp  will generator  (N* len(J) + 1)  files

len(J) for different J test values, each will have N 

1 file is for time spend.

Then proj_1_optimal_J.ipynb will calculate the sigma value per second.
We are going to use that to estimate how much error will get for large scale Monte Carlo.


### the data folder is not contain is this repo, due to file number limit
